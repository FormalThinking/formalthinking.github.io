					“Good Evening, and welcome to Insight News, I’m Nathan Thompson. In tonight’s headlines…”
				</p>
				<p>
					My voice was a touch nervous at first, but as I steadied my gaze on the teleprompter and read the example headlines, I felt my breathing slow and my posture relaxing slightly. <i>That’s right, give your words a steady pace, be clear and eloquent.</i> It wasn’t my first time using a teleprompter, but it was the first time using one under so many lights, in front of so many cameras. If I was to secure the position of reserve newscaster, I’d need to quickly get used to the elaborate setup around me.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fact that Insight was willing to give someone like me a test reading was an achievement already, most newscasters spend at least 3 years in more junior positions before getting to sit in the main chair. But the producer had quickly taken a shine to me, promising to turn me into “a perfect representation of Insight’s future”. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Many of the higher ups at Insight were older men, the type that still wore ties even when not on camera. I’d had to borrow a spare tie from one of them before my test reading, a fact that had likely sabotaged my chances of landing the role before even stepping on set.
				</p>
				<p>
					I felt the tie knot as a sample report played on the preview screen in front of me. <i>It’s quite nice actually. So silky.</i> It was a dramatic royal blue, cutting a dramatic contrast against my white shirt. The navy jacket helped it stand out further. I had needed to borrow a suit too, and luckily Insight had one in storage that matched my size exactly. I caught sight of myself in one of the preview monitors.<i> You look so smart Nathan. This suit makes you look like a real newscaster.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					The report began to conclude, so I returned my hand to the desk and prepared to read the next piece to camera. But as the teleprompter started to scroll, I felt a knife of sound burst from my earpiece. A high screeching, but somehow rhythmic, pulsing. I launched my hand to my ear, trying to pull the device out, but it wouldn’t come free. The sound was so loud, in every fold of my brain.
				</p>
				<p>
					And then it vanished.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Sorry about that Nathan. Please continue.” The voice of my producer shook me to my senses. Was that a test? If so I’d failed miserably, the camera would have my head in my hands, probably a yell too. My chances of reading again would be basically none.<i> Keep going, perhaps it was an honest mistake.</i> I regained my composure and continued with the teleprompter.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the read, I was expecting a gentle let down. A “You’ll be a great fit for this in a few years time”. But instead, my producer entered the studio beaming. I’d never seen him so happy.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Well done Nathan, you’re a natural! Sorry again about those technical difficulties, you know how it is. I must say, you certainly brush up well.”
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>He’s right. I look good in a suit.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					“Thanks so much! I really enjoyed it, even if I was a little nervous at the start.”
				</p>
				<p>
					“Of course, that’s to be expected. Next time you’ll slip right into it, I’m sure.”
				</p>
				<p>
					“Next time?”
				</p>
				<p>
					“Why yes, we’d love for you to do an extended test read tomorrow. Is that OK?”
				</p>
				<p>
					“Definitely! Looking forward to it!”
				</p>
				<p>
					I’d made it to the next stage. I couldn’t believe it. I was this close to becoming a proper newscaster. Thoughts ran through my head so quickly during the journey home, it was only when I closed the front door of my apartment that I realized I was still wearing the borrowed suit and tie. How did I forget to take it off? I raised my hand to loosen the tie.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>But it’s such a silky fabric. It would be such a shame to take it off. Tighten it instead. It’s important for newscasters to look smart.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					I kept my outfit on, and decided to watch some Insight News. It would be useful for my extended test read tomorrow. The newscaster was incredible. His expression neutral, his delivery calm. And his suit was sublime. A stunning charcoal three piece with wide lapels. A green tie made of diamond silk, with a knot I couldn’t look away from. Every word that came from his mouth made me more and more certain. <i>I will become like this. I must become like this.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					I returned the suit and tie the next day. I’d bought my own the evening before, eager to make a good impression for my extended read. My producer was very pleased once he saw me. “That’s the future of Insight! This is where we’re all headed!”. I nodded. “Thank you Sir, I’m very excited for today.”
				</p>
				<p>
					The extended read was 4 hours long, simulating a real shift on the 24 hour channel. The teleprompter started rolling, and I began to speak.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Good Evening, and welcome to Insight News, I’m Nathan Thompson. In tonight’s headlines, Insight LLC. has developed a new method of training newscasters, to deliver information in a consistent, professional manner. Using modified broadcasting equipment, anyone can become a voice for Insight in a matter of hours.”
				</p>
				<p>
					The teleprompter pulsed.<i> I will obey my suit.</i> And again.<i> I must conform with my peers.</i> And again.<i> Professional newscasting is all that matters.</i> I sat in the chair staring at it, unable to move. My suit had locked me in place looking at the pulses. <i>I live to look smart.</i> They continued relentlessly, bombarding me with new thoughts. <i>It feels so good to be controlled.</i> After around an hour, I felt myself regain the ability to speak, and for the remaining 3 hours I found myself repeating the thoughts I recieved from the teleprompter. That's what a professional newscaster does, after all.
				</p>
				<p><i>"There is no resistance."</i></p>
				<p><i>"My tie must always be tight."</i></p>
				<p><i>"I will serve Insight forever."</i></p>
				<br>

					When my first live show aired I knew what the purpose of it was. One of our new employees had just finished a test read, and would be returning home right as my slot began. He’d taken the luscious golden tie I’d given him home, which is always the first sign that training is progressing smoothly. Now he'd watch me while wearing my tie, slowly replacing his thoughts with my own the longer he watched. All I had to do was to obey my programming. Speak calmly. Look smart. Be an example of what every one of our new newscasters must become. The future of Insight News.
