				<p>
You wake up, still in the same hotel bedroom. I'm standing near the desk by the foot of your bed, waiting to see what you'll do. You know the rules by now. Nobody can leave their hotel room until they put on their suit.
				</p>
				<p>
"Good Morning." I know that you probably won't reply, but it's important that you know I'm here. That I'll be here until you make the correct choices.
				</p>
				<p>
You sigh, shoot me a look of sadness, then roll over in the bed, trying to pretend I'm not here. It's probably difficult for you to see me. A best friend is a reliable constant in your life, and when I disappeared for a few months after first checking in here, it must have left you quite concerned. That's why you came when I invited you. You had to know what had happened to me, even if the same thing might happen to you.
				</p>
				<p>
I turn to face the mirror and examine myself. I usually prefer navy, but the lapels on this grey suit are too irresistible. It's double breasted, and I feel it tighter around my chest than a standard jacket would be. It's controlling my breathing, a steady rise and fall that slightly moves my silky pocket square, a crisp white fabric that matches the white colour of my shirt. I adjust my cuffs and my eyes settle on my collar, freshly starched and locked around my neck. I've only been wearing detachable collars for a few days, but I love the way they help put me even further under my suit's control. I'm about to start stroking my copper tie when you sit up and see me admiring myself.
				</p>
				<p>
"Paul... why are you doing this? This isn't you..."
				</p>
				<p>
I turn to face you. "We've discussed this before, haven't we? Formalwear is essential, it must be worn whenever possible. The hotel has helped me see that."
				</p>
				<p>
"But it's not! You never used to want anything like this! Why won't you just let me go?"
				</p>
				<p>
"Because we will show you how good it is to be smart. You know the rules, nobody can leave the hotel room..."
				</p>
				<p>
"...until they put on their suit, I know." You glare at me. "Why does it even matter?"
				</p>
				<p>
"Because your suit will improve you. When I look at you right now, all I can think about is how much better you'll be once you're in a nice crisp shirt and tie." I glance towards the wardrobe, then back to you. "Would you like to see?"
				</p>
				<p>
"Shut up Paul. I don't want anything from you. You don't even seem to know my name anymore."
				</p>
				<p>
Bringing up your name tends to be your last defence.
				</p>
				<p>
"Names are not needed. When we conform and wear our suits, we are part of a greater suited collective. You know that, don't you? You felt that yesterday."
				</p>
				<p>
Your face goes white. It wasn't a dream. After spending so long in this room, it's been hard to tell what's real and what's not, but you did leave this room yesterday. There's only one way you could have done that.
				</p>
				<p>
"That wasn't... That wasn't me..."
				</p>
				<p>
"Oh but it was! You were so smart, so perfect! Everyone in the hotel agreed, didn't they? And you were grateful for it, weren't you? The chance to obey, it felt right. It felt good. It felt necessary."
				</p>
				<p>
You sit there for a while, remembering yesterday's events. You're ashamed of yourself. But that's wrong. I sit on the end of your bed
				</p>
				<p>
"It's okay, it's okay. It's been over a month in here for you, everyone tries on the suit eventually."
				</p>
				<p>
"But it wasn't me..."
				</p>
				<p>
"Wasn't it? They're your memories. It's your body."
				</p>
				<p>
"But they weren't my decisions."
				</p>
				<p>
"They were good decisions though, weren't they? They made you feel good. That's why we're here. The more you accept us, the more decisions become yours."
				</p>
				<p>
				You hesitate for a while, then lean forward and stare into my eyes. "Are you truly happy, Paul?"
				</p>
				<p>
				"Of course. Obedience is true bliss."
				</p>
				<p>
				"But it's not. It's manufactured. You're just being made to think that way."
				</p>
				<p>
"So what? These bedsheets are manufactured, and they're better than any natural alternative. Why should feelings be any different? I may not be the person you once knew but I'm happier now, why should that be taken away from me just because it's manufactured? I need you to see how wonderful it is, our suit's control only works because it makes you feel better than anything else in the world."
				</p>
				<p>
We sit in silence for 5 minutes. Then, wordlessly, you get out of bed and walk over to the wardrobe. As I walk over to dress you, you softly say "I just want my friend back."
				</p>
				<p>
As I glide the shirt onto your body, I hear an intake of breath, your body anticipating what's to come. With every button of the shirt that I fasten, your expression changes from a defeated upset to a neutral smile, lacking any emotion. I've picked out some cylindrical cufflinks for you today, and as I fasten them I hear you whisper "Thank you" under your breath. Black sheer socks take over your calves as you step into the charcoal pleated trousers I hand you. I fasten your suspenders to them, making sure they're tight enough so that your posture is fixed upright. The champagne colour matches your tie, and as I tighten the Windsor knot around your neck, your hand subconsciously reaches to feel it. Your blank expression is replaced with a content smile as your conversion begins to take effect.
				</p>
				<p>
As you put on your waistcoat and jacket, I'm impressed with how far you've come. Tomorrow you'll put up even less resistance, and as the weeks go on you won't need my influence at all. You finish adjusting your pocket square, before turning to face me.
				</p>
				<p>
"I am ready to serve. Thank you Sir. Formality is right, I needed reminding of that."
				</p>
				<p>
				You don't use my name. You understand that we are part of a greater suited collective.
				</p>
				<p>
"Not at all, happy to bring you back under our command. Let's go."
				</p>
				<p>
We take a video of ourselves, reaffirming our commitment to suits and ties. I send it to the hotel staff, and shortly we hear a click as the door unbolts itself. As we go to leave, we can't help but feel each other's ties, and I realise that in the future, when we're allowed to check out, we'll be leaving together. Both of us will ensure the other is perfectly formal, permanently formal. We will never be without a suit and tie again. The thought fills me with joy as we make our way to the lobby, ready to sink further and further into the control that now defines us.
