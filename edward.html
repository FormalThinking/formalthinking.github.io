				<p>
					Our company tries to avoid mandatory overtime. It's important to stick to a regular orderly schedule, after all. That said, we're known for our productivity, and our output wouldn't be what it is without the additional devotion our employees show us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Take Edward for example. Edward came to us having heard about our high salaries and perfect employee satisfaction rate, and we were confident that he would fit in well here. But when he started, he'd only work the standard day, 9am to 5pm. That simply would not do.
				</p>
				<p>
					During Edward's first performance review, we gave him a new tie. He used to wear these flimsy thin pieces of fabric, so we gave him something a little more professional and asked him to wear it tomorrow. You see, once Edward put it on, and felt the wave of bold red silk wrap around his neck, he began to see the sort of benefits our company provides.
				</p>
				<p>
					Edward worked for an extra hour that day. The next day he wore the tie again, and worked an extra two. He told us he had simply lost track of time, but we were pleased with his growth, so we ensured he went home with a beautiful set of new white shirts. Poplin weave, a crisp collar, double cuffs that would be sealed in place by a weighty pair of silver cufflinks. Every employee receives them at some stage, but Edward progressed particularly quickly.
				</p>
				<p>
					He had felt uncomfortable about accepting such a large gift at first, but when Edward came into work the next day, he felt only gratitude. The cool fabric encompassing his body left no wrinkle in sight, and the rigid collar kept his head upright and focused, while also perfectly framing the bold red tie he had become so attached to. We always encourage our employees to go above and beyond, so nobody commented when Edward continued to come into work over the weekend. All of his colleagues worked weekends, and Edward didn't want to miss any opportunity to be wearing his tie alongside them. It wasn't long before his next performance review, where he simply smiled and said "It feels good and right to work as much as possible for the company". All of his colleagues had already shared the same sentiment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Edward has brought plenty of his own formalwear now. Like all good employees, he's making good use of our benefits system, where his salary goes towards outfits that we alter to provide the wearer with ultimate satisfaction and dedication to the company. We also deliver his new clothes directly to him, so he's able to work for as long as possible. His schedule is regular and structured now, 15 hours of work a day, every day. He's very satisfied too, we've really given him a sense of purpose.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why am I telling you all this? Well you see, we want to make sure you're just as satisfied as Edward. We look after our employees here, and the fact that you're only working for 12 hours on weekdays means we're not doing enough to keep you absorbed in your career. You want to work more, don't you? You want to wear that tie we gave you for longer and longer. That's right, keep stroking it, feel the silk swim through your fingers, through your thoughts. You love how it focuses your mind, don't you? Work is the only thing that matters. Obedience is the only thing that matters. It feels good and right to work as much as possible for the company. Edward's waiting outside for you with a gorgeous new three piece suit, and we can't wait to see you in it tomorrow. Who knows, by your next performance review you might even be as dedicated as him...
